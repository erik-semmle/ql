<overview>
	<p>
		Dynamically constructing HTML with inputs from exported functions may 
		inadvertently leave a client open to XSS attacks.
		
		Clients using the exported function may use inputs containing unsafe HTML,
		and if these inputs end up in the DOM, the client may be vulnerable to
		cross-site scripting attacks.
	</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

	<p>
		If possible, use safe APIs when inserting HTML into the DOM.  
		Such as writing to the <code>innerText</code> property instead of <code>innerHTML</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alternatively, use a HTML sanitizer to escape/remove unsafe content.
	</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

	<p>
		The following example shows a library function that shows a boldface name
		by writing to the <code>innerHTML</code> property of an element.
	</p>

	<sample src="examples/unsafe-html-construction.js" />

	<p>
		This library function, however, does not escape unsafe HTML, and a client
		that calls the function with user-supplied input may be vulnerable to
		cross-site scripting attacks.
	</p>

	<p>
		To avoid such attacks, a program can use safe APIs such as <code>innerText</code>.

		Alternatively, use a HTML sanitizer to remove unsafe content.
